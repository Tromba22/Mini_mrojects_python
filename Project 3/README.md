# Pupils improvement of studies
## by Ali Trabelsi Karoui


## Dataset

> The study assesses students’ mathematics, science, and reading skills and contains a wealth of information on students’ background, their school and the organisation of education systems. For most countries, the sample is around 5,000 students, but in some countries the number is even higher. In total, the PISA 2012 dataset contains data on 485 490 pupils.

> Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

> The main table is student2012. Pupil performance in mathematics, reading and science is coded by plausible values. You can find them in columns: PV1MATH-PV5MATH (for math), PV1READ-PV5READ (for reading) and PV1SCIE-PV5SCIE (for science). For given area all five values PV1- PV5 are just independent estimations of the student performance in given area. For exploration it is fine to use only PV1.

## Summary of Findings

> Scores of all the the three subjects in our study (Math, Science and Reading) 
are highly correlated, and a good student or pupil which is good in one of them,
is high probably good in the other two. Wealth could play inmportant role for a 
better education. High qualified parents alongside with fukl-time job show better 
scores in Math and science. Redaing shows in part of that well qualified parents 
and having one of them at home make great improvement in the score. Furthermore, 
 our study depicts that the influence of all charactersitics differ from Devloped 
 countries to non developed countries. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on juson the reults for the main subjects and their 
relationship to father and mothers conditions. I start by introducing the
sample overview, followed by the pattern in gender, and OECD distribution, then plot 
the different distribution of the ccategorical data, and make transformation to effort.

> Afterwards, I present each of the quantitative data and its relationship to each other.
 To start,I use the scatter plots of results and subjects' results. I'm looking at the
hole relationship with the other categeorical data using boxplots and histograms, alongside 
staked plots. Otherwise, we have used a 3D plot to highlight the relatiship between the three 
quantitaive variables and their relatonship to categorical variable of sibiligs living with. 
I've made sure to use different color palettes for each quality variable 
to make sure it is clear that they're different between plots.
